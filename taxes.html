      <h1>Taxes</h1>
      <h2>What Are Taxes?</h2>
      <p>
        Taxes are mandatory contributions levied on individuals or corporations
        by a government entity—whether local, regional, or national. Tax
        revenues finance government activities, including public works and
        services such as roads and schools, or programs such as Social Security
        and Medicare. In economics, taxes fall on whoever pays the burden of the
        tax, whether this is the entity being taxed, such as a business, or the
        end consumers of the business’s goods. From an accounting perspective,
        there are various taxes to consider, including payroll taxes, federal
        and state income taxes, and sales taxes.
