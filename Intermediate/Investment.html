      <h2>What Is an Investment?</h2>
      <p>
        An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating
        income or appreciation. Appreciation refers to an increase in the value
        of an asset over time. When an individual purchases a good as an
        investment, the intent is not to consume the good but rather to use it
        in the future to create wealth. An investment always concerns the outlay
        of some resource today—time, effort, money, or an asset—in hopes of a
        greater payoff in the future than what was originally put in. For
        example, an investor may purchase a monetary asset now with the idea
        that the asset will provide income in the future or will later be sold
        at a higher price for a profit.

          Appreciation refers to an increase in the value of an asset over time.
          When an individual purchases a good as an investment, the intent is
          not to consume the good but rather to use it in the future to create
          wealth. An investment always concerns the outlay of some resource

          for a profit. Key Takeaways An investment involves putting capital to
          use today in order to increase its value over time. An investment
          requires putting capital to work, in the form of time, money, effort,
          etc., in hopes of a greater payoff in the future than what was
          originally put in. An investment can refer to any medium or mechanism
          used for generating future income, including bonds, stocks, real
          estate property, or alternative investments. Investments usually do
          not come with guarantees of appreciation; it is possible to end up
          with less money than with what you started. Investments can be
          diversified to reduce risk, though this may reduce the amount of
          earning potential. Investment Investopedia / Nez Riaz How an

        <h2>Types OF Investment</h2>
        <p>
          There's arguably endless opportunities to invest; after all, upgrading
          the tires on your vehicle could be seen as an investment that enhances
          the usefulness and future value of the asset. Below are common types
          of investments in which people use to appreciate their capital.

            Stocks/Equities:
            <p>
              A share of stock is a piece of ownership of a public or private
              company. By owning stock, the investor may be entitled to dividend
              distributions generated from the net profit of the company. As the
              company becomes more successful and other investors seek to buy
              that company's stock, it's value can also appreciate and be sold
              for capital gains. The two primary types of stocks to invest in
              are common stock and preferred stock. Common stock often includes
              voting right and participation eligibility in certain matters.
              Preferred stock often have first claim to dividends and must be
              paid before common shareholders.

            Bonds/Fixed-Income Securities:
            <p>
              A bond is an investment that often demands an upfront investment,
              then pays a reoccurring amount over the life of the bond. Then,
              when the bond matures, the investor receives the capital invested
              into the bond back. Similar to debt, bond investments are a
              mechanism for certain entities to raise money. Many government
              entities and companies issue bonds; then, investors can contribute
              capital to earn a yield. The recurring payment awarded to
              bondholders is called a coupon payment. Because the coupon payment
              on a bond investment is usually fixed, the price of a bond will
              often fluctuate to change the bond's yield. For example, a bond
              paying 5% will become cheaper to buy if there are market
              opportunities to earn 6%; by falling in price, the bond will
              naturally earn a higher yield.

            Index Funds and Mutual Funds:
            <p>
              Instead of selecting each individual company to invest in, index
              funds, mutual funds, and other types of funds often aggregate
              specific investments to craft one investment vehicle. For example,
              an investor can buy shares of a single mutual fund that holds
              ownership of small cap, emerging market companies instead of
              having to research and select each company on its own. Mutual
              funds are actively managed by a firm, while index funds are often
              passively-managed. This means that the investment professionals
              overseeing the mutual fund is trying to beat a specific benchmark,
              while index funds often attempt to simply copy or imitate a
              benchmark. For this reason, mutual funds may be a more expense
              fund to invest in compared to more passive-style funds.

            Real Estate:
            <p>
              Real estate investments are often broadly defined as investments
              in physical, tangible spaces that can be utilized. Land can be
              built on, office buildings can be occupied, warehouses can store
              inventory, and residential properties can house families. Real
              estate investments may encompass acquiring sites, developing sites
              for specific uses, or purchasing ready-to-occupy operating sites.
              In some contexts, real estate may broadly encompass certain types
              of investments that may yield commodities. For example, an
              investor can invest in farmland; in addition to reaping the reward
              of land value appreciation, the investment earns a return based on
              the crop yield and operating income.

            Commodities:
            <p>
              Commodities are often raw materials such as agriculture, energy,
              or metals. Investors can choose to invest in actual tangible
              commodities (i.e. owning a bar of gold) or can choose alternative
              investment products that represent digital ownership (i.e. a gold
              ETF). Commodities can be an investment because they are often used
              as inputs to society. Consider oil, gas, or other forms of energy.
              During periods of economic growth, companies often have greater
              energy needs to ship more products or manufacture additional
              goods. In addition, consumers may have greater demand for energy
              due to travel. In this example, the price of commodities
              fluctuates and may yield a profit for an investor.

            Cryptocurrency:
            <p>
              Cryptocurrency is a blockchain-based currency used to transact or
              hold digital value. Cryptocurrency companies can issue coins or
              tokens that may appreciate in value. These tokens can be used to
              transact with or pay fees to transact using specific networks. In
              addition to capital appreciation, cryptocurrency can be staked on
              a blockchain. This means that when investors agree to lock their
              tokens on a network to help validate transactions, these investors
              will be rewarded with additional tokens. In addition,
              cryptocurrency has given rise to decentralized finance, a digital
              branch of finance that enables users to loan, leverage, or
              alternatively utilize currency.

            Collectibles:
            <p>
              A less traditional form of investing, collecting or purchasing
              collectibles involves acquiring rare items in anticipation of
              those items becoming in higher demand. Ranging from sports
              memorabilia to comic books, these physical items often require
              substantial physical preservation especially considering that
              older items usually carry higher value. The concept behind
              collectibles is no different than other forms of investing such as
              equities. Both predict that the popularity of something will
              increase in the future. For example, a current artist may not be
              popular but changes in global trends, styles, and market interest.
              However, their art may become more valuable in time should the
              general population take a stronger interest in their work.
