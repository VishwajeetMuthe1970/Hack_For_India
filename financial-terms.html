      <h1 id="title">Finance Terms for Beginners</h1>
      <p>
        Increasing your financial literacy is important, especially if you’re
        just beginning your journey in finance. Whether you’re opening your
        first bank account or just trying to make sure you’re well equipped with
        knowledge, there are certain concepts that all beginners should learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without understanding how to use money, you can’t successfully navigate
        life in our society. While there are ever-escalating levels of financial
        literacy, there are certain basic concepts that beginners must master
        before moving up the ladder of monetary knowledge. Here are a dozen
        crucial terms that you need to comprehend on your journey to financial
        fluency.
      </p>
      <div id="checking_acc">
        <h2>Checking Account</h2>
        <p>
          You have to keep your money somewhere, and generally, the safest place
          is in a savings bank or credit union, as they are insured by the
          Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) against losses. These financial
          institutions offer a variety of accounts, and a checking account is
          one of them. A checking account is designed to provide quick access to
          your funds for daily transactional needs, such as paying bills or
          buying products
        </p>
        <p>
          You should keep only the amount of money that you need for expenses in
          your checking account, though that should be at least enough to meet
          the bank’s minimum balance requirement, which allows you to avoid
          paying a monthly fee to keep your account open. You can tap your cash
          by writing a paper check to any person to whom or entity to which you
          owe money, but be careful—do not overdraw your account by asking for
          more than is in it. If you do, you could wind up with bounced checks
          and overdraft fees.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Debit">
        <h2>Debit Card</h2>
        <p>
          You can also access the cash in your checking account by using a debit
          card, which in this digital age is a more popular and convenient
          vehicle than a paper check. Debit cards allow you to avoid carrying
          cash. Most stores accept them, and all you have to do is swipe your
          card through a machine and enter in your personal identification
          number (PIN) to transfer the cash from your account to the vendor.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use your card at an automated teller machine (ATM) to get
          cash. Of course, you cannot access more money than is in your account,
          and some banks will charge you a fee to use the card.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="saving">
        <h2>Savings Account</h2>
        <p>
          A savings account is where you keep the money that you are, well,
          saving. Funds are held for future use rather than the cash you need to
          pay for regular expenses. Depending on how much you hold in it, you
          may have to pay a monthly fee to keep the account open. There may also
          be a minimum balance requirement and a limit on how much money you can
          withdraw in a given time frame. As the bank has use of the money while
          it sits in your account (it can lend it to other customers), it
          compensates you by paying monthly interest, increasing your
          hard-earned savings. Most savings accounts are also insured against
          losses by the FDIC
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="intetest">
        <h2>Intetest</h2>
        <p>
          Interest is, quite simply, the price that a person or entity pays for
          borrowing money. Interest is determined as a percentage of the amount
          borrowed over a period of time. There are two kinds of interest:
          simple and compound. The first is paid only on the actual amount
          borrowed, called the principal. The second is paid on both the
          principal and the interest already paid. As a result, compound
          interest earns more money for a lender than simple interest.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="loan">
        <h2>Loan</h2>
        <p>
          A loan is an agreement between two people or entities where one party
          temporarily gives a sum of money to the other. The party getting the
          money pays interest for the privilege. Loans can be used for such
          purposes as buying big-ticket items such as a car, a house, or an
          education. The loan terms will include the length of time before the
          money has to be paid back (known as the date of maturity) and the
          percentage amount and kind of interest to be paid and when. There may
          also be collateral involved, which is something a borrower offers as a
          guarantee that they will pay the money back. If the borrower can’t pay
          it back when required, an event known as a default, then the lender
          takes possession of the collateral instead of getting their money
          returned
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="credit_card">
        <h2>Credit Card</h2>
        <p>
          A credit card is a kind of loan that is available to consumers whose
          finances are in good enough shape to qualify for it. A financial
          institution issues a plastic card with an account number and the
          cardholder’s name on it. The card can be used to purchase goods in
          stores and online up to a certain amount of money, known as the credit
          limit. It can also be used to take a cash advance if the cardholder
          needs money. The cardholder must pay back the amount of money used,
          either all at once every month or in minimum monthly installments. If
          they keep a balance on the card, monthly interest is charged and added
          to it. This is known as revolving credit. Credit card interest rates
          tend to be high, and as interest not paid is added to the principal
          every month, they can quickly balloon to an amount that the cardholder
          may be unable to pay back, which is why it is always wiser to pay your
          balance in full every month. Credit card debt is a significant problem
          for many people in the United States.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="inflation">
        <h2>Inflation</h2>
        <p>
          Bonds may provide a steady stream of income, but the amount is fixed.
          This means that their value can be reduced by inflation, which is an
          overall increase in the price of goods and services over time. If
          things cost more but your income doesn’t increase to match the rise in
          prices, then your money is worth less than it was before, because it
          can’t purchase as much as it used to be able to buy. To calculate the
          rate of inflation, the government looks at a consumer basket of
          commonly purchased items, known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI),
          tracking the cost of buying the items in the basket over time.1617
          Economists theorize a variety of causes of inflation, including too
          much available money in an economy, expectations of rising prices
          becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, and sudden shocks to an economic
          system.16 An example of the last would be the COVID-19 pandemic, which
          caused soaring worldwide inflation in 2021 and 2022
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="taxes">
        <h2>Taxes</h2>
        <p>
          It was Benjamin Franklin who wrote, “In this world, nothing is certain
          except death and taxes.”Governments, whether federal, state, or local,
          tax their citizens to raise revenues to fund their activities and
          services, such as building and maintaining infrastructure (e.g.,
          roads, bridges, subway systems), running schools, fielding a military,
          and providing social programs like Medicare and Social Security. Taxes
          are mandatory, have been around for more than 5,000 years, and are how
          we pay for the collective good. There are three basic types of taxes:
          income, property, and sales. They are levied as a percentage on what
          you earn, own, and buy. Federal, state, and local income taxes are
          withheld from the paychecks of salaried employees. For the
          self-employed, federal income taxes must be paid only in estimated
          quarterly installments.Federal income tax returns must be filed
          annually, usually no later than April 15, though the date can vary
          slightly depending on weekends and holidays. Most states also use
          April 15, though there are some exceptions.
