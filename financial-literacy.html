      <h1>The Importance of Financial Literacy</h1>
      <p>
        In its National Financial Capability Study the Financial Industry
        Regulatory Authority (FINRA) found that Americans with higher levels of
        financial literacy were more likely to make ends meet, spend less of
        their income, create a three-month emergency fund, and open a retirement
        account than those with lower financial literacy. FINRA. "National Study
        by FINRA Foundation Finds U.S. Adults Financial Capability Has Generally
        Grown Despite Pandemic Disruption." Making informed financial decisions
        is more important than ever. Take retirement planning. Many workers once
        relied on pension plans to fund their retirement lives, with the
        financial burden and decision-making for pension funds borne by the
        companies or governments that sponsored them. Today, few workers get
        pensions; instead some are offered the option of participating in a
        401(k) plan. This involves decisions that employees themselves have to
        make about contribution levels and investment choices. Those without
        employer options need to actively seek out and open individual
        retirement accounts (IRAs) and other tax-advantaged retirement accounts.
        Add to this people’s increasing life spans (leading to longer
        retirements), Social Security benefits that barely support basic
        survival, complicated health and other insurance options, more complex
        savings and investment instruments to select from—and a plethora of
        choices from banks, credit unions, brokerage firms, credit card
        companies, and more. It’s clear that financial literacy is a must for
        making thoughtful and informed decisions, avoiding unnecessary levels of
        debt, helping family members through these complex decisions, and having
        adequate income in retirement.
