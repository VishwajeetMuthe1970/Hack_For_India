      <h1>5 Elements Of Finance</h1>
      <p>
        There are five elements of a financial statement: Assets, Liabilities,
        Equity, Income, and Expenses. Each of these categories has its own
        unique set of information that is important to track for a business.
      </p>
      <div id="Assets">
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>
          Assets are things that a company owns and have value. Assets are
          typically recorded on the balance sheet at their original cost (also
          called historical cost) less accumulated depreciation, which is an
          expense that reflects the wear and tears on assets over time. Assets
          include fixed assets and current assets. Typically, businesses like to
          keep track of their assets in order to measure how much they are worth
          or to serve as collateral for borrowing money or other financing
          activities. Assets also help investors make decisions on whether the
          company is doing well financially since they can see what assets are
          available to be used for future growth.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Liability">
        <h2>Liability</h2>
        <p>
          Liabilities are obligations of the business that may need to be paid
          back over a period of time. These would include both short-term
          (current) liabilities such as accounts payable and long-term
          liabilities such as mortgages. Typically, businesses like to keep
          track of their liabilities in order to measure the total amount that
          they owe or are obligated to payout. Liabilities also help investors
          make decisions on whether the company is doing well financially. Since
          they can see how much debt the business has taken on and if it may be
          too much to handle.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Equity">
        <h2>Equity</h2>
        <p>
          Equities are claims by owners of a business on its assets after all
          debts have been paid off. These would include things such as common
          stock, preferred stock, treasury stock (stock repurchased by a
          company), and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).
          Typically, businesses like to keep track of their equities in order to
          measure ownership interest or how many shares of a company an
          individual has
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Income">
        <h2>Income</h2>
        <p>
          Income is money that the company makes from its regular business
          operations before accounting for expenses such as taxes, interest
          payments, and other financing activities. Income does not include
          income from other sources such as investments because there may be no
          cash inflow to offset any outflow that may occur when these assets are
          sold (when funds are pulled out). As a result, itâ€™s helpful to keep
          track of what an organisation earned in order to help make better
          investment decisions in the future.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Expenses">
        <h2>Expenses</h2>
        <p>
          Expenses are money that the company spent on its regular business
          operations before accounting for income. Expenses are reduced from
          total income to derive the net profit or loss of the business.
          Typically, businesses like to keep track of their expenses in order to
          measure how much it costs them to generate revenue or to measure how
          profitable they are. Expenses also help investors make decisions on
          whether the company is doing well financially since they can see if
          the organisation is spending more than what it makes and if so,
          whether this spending will lead to future problems.
