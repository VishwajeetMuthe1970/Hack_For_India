      <h1>Technical Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        Technical analysis is the study of the price movement and patterns of a
        security. By scrutinizing a security's past price action, primarily
        through charts and indicators, traders can forecast future price
        direction.Technical analysis is a tool or process that uses market data
        to forecast securities' likely future price movement - such as a stock
        or currency pair. The principle underlying technical analysis's validity
        is the idea that all market participants' aggregate activities - buying
        and selling - accurately represent all relevant information relative to
        a traded security and hence consistently assign a fair market value to
        the security

        <h2>What is Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Technical analysis is a trading methodology used for assessing the
          investments made. It helps to determine the trading prospects by
          examining statistical trends collected from trading activity. It
          assesses the value of a security on the basis of business results such
          as sales and earnings. It also provides a keen focus on the study of
          volume and price.

        <h2>Understanding Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Technical analysis methods can be used to investigate how the demand
          and supply for specific securities affect price, volume, and implied
          volatility swings. It is based on the notion that historical trading
          activity and price movements in the securities can be used as
          meaningful indications. When paired with appropriate trading or
          investment criteria, these indicators may aid in predicting market
          fluctuations in the future. Using various charting tools, it is widely
          used to generate trade signals for short-term trading. They are,
          nevertheless, useful in improving the appraisal of a security's
          strength or weakness with respect to the greater market or its sector.
          Analysts use this information to help them enhance their overall
          assessment estimate.

        <h2>Use of Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Professional analysts frequently employ technical analysis in
          conjunction with other sorts of studies. Retail traders' decisions
          could only be based on price graphs and related statistics. Yet,
          equities analysts rarely rely just on technical or fundamental
          analysis. We can use technical analysis on any security with
          historical trading data. Commodities, currencies, stocks, and other
          securities are examples of technical analysis. Technical analysis is
          often used in commodity and FX markets because traders are concerned
          with price movement in the near term.

        <h2>Indicators of Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          More than a hundred patterns and indicators for trading in stock
          market technical analysis have been established by researchers from
          various businesses. Technical analysts have created a variety of
          trading methods to assist them in forecasting and trading price
          fluctuations. These indicators are designed to identify current market
          trends, such as areas of support and resistance. Others are concerned
          with determining the strength of a trend.

        <h2>Components of Trend Lines</h2>
        <ol>

            <b>Trend Lines: </b>
            <p>
              The assumption underlying technical analysis is that prices trend.
              As a result, the employment of trend lines is critical for trend
              identification as well as trend confirmation. A straight line is a
              trend line. It joins two or more price points and then continues
              into the future to serve as a support or resistance line. Trend
              lines are particularly beneficial for stock technical analysis.

            <b>Support and Resistance: </b>
            <p>
              Support and resistance are essentially price marks on a chart.
              These points are predicted to generate the greatest amount of
              buying or selling. In technical analysis, the support price is the
              price at which there are more buyers than sellers. In the
              technical market, the resistance price is the price at which more
              sellers are expected than buyers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Volume: </b>
            <p>
              Volume in technical stock analysis refers to the number of shares
              of a stock that are traded on a certain day or period of time.
              Volume is critical since it validates previously determined trend
              directions. Volume is an important input. While studying stock
              charts, consider both price and volume.
