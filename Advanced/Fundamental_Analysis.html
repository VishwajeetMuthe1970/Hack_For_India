        <h2>What Is Fundamental Analysis?</h2>
        <p>
          Fundamental analysis (FA) measures a security's intrinsic value by
          examining related economic and financial factors. Intrinsic value is
          the value of an investment based on the issuing company's financial
          situation and current market and economic conditions. Fundamental
          analysts study anything that can affect the security's value, from
          macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry
          conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the
          company's management. The end goal is to determine a number that an
          investor can compare with a security's current price to see whether
          the security is undervalued or overvalued by other investors.

        <h2>Understanding Fundamental Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Fundamental analysis is usually done from a macro to micro perspective
          to identify securities that are not correctly priced by the market.
          Analysts typically study, in order: The overall state of the economy
          The strength of the specific industry The financial performance of the
          company issuing the stock
        </p>

        <h2>Sources for Fundamental Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Fundamental analysis uses publicly available financial data to
          evaluate the value of an investment. The data is recorded on financial
          statements such as quarterly and annual reports and filings like the
          10-Q (quarterly) or 10-K (annual). The 8-K is also informative because
          public companies must file it any time a reportable event occurs, like
          an acquisition or upper-level management change.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="intrinsic">
        <h2>Intrinsic Value</h2>
        <p>
          One of the primary assumptions behind fundamental analysis is that a
          stock's current price often does not fully reflect the value of the
          company when compared to publicly available financial data. A second
          assumption is that the value reflected from the company's fundamental
          data is more likely to be closer to the true value of the stock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intrinsic value means something different in stock valuation than in
          options trading. Option pricing uses a standard calculation for
          intrinsic value, while it can be calculated in many different ways for
          a stock.
