      <h1>Trading</h1>
      <p>
        Trading is the buying and selling of securities, such as stocks, bonds,
        currencies and commodities, as opposed to investing, which suggests a
        buy-and-hold strategy. Trading success depends on a trader's ability to
        be profitable over time.

        <h2>How to Trade Stocks</h2>
        <p>
          Millions of neophytes try their hand at the market casino each year,
          but most walk away a little poorer and a lot wiser, having never
          reached their full potential. The majority of those who fail have one
          thing in common: They haven't mastered the basic skills needed to tilt
          the odds in their favor. However, if one takes adequate time to learn
          them, it's possible to be on the way to increasing one's odds of
          success. World markets attract speculative capital like moths to a
          flame; most people throw money at securities without understanding why
          prices move higher or lower. Instead, they chase hot tips, make binary
          bets, and sit at the feet of gurus, letting them recommend
          buy-and-sell decisions that make no sense. A better path is to learn
          how to trade the markets with skill and authority. Start with a
          self-examination that takes a close look at your relationship with
          money. Do you view life as a struggle, with a difficult effort
          required to earn each dollar? Do you believe personal magnetism will
          attract market wealth to you in the same way it does in other life
          pursuits? More ominously, have you lost money on a regular basis
          through other activities and hope the financial markets will treat you
          more kindly? Whatever your belief system, the market is likely to
          reinforce that internal view again through profits and losses. Hard
          work and charisma both support financial success, but losers in other
          walks of life are likely to turn into losers in the trading game.
          Don't panic if this sounds like you. Instead, take the self-help route
          and learn about the relationship between money and self-worth.

            <b>Open a Trading Account: </b>
            <p>
              Sorry if it seems we're stating the obvious, but you never know!
              (Remember the person who did everything to set up his new
              computer—except to plug it in?) Find a good online stock broker
              and open a stock brokerage account. Even if you already have a
              personal account, it's not a bad idea to keep a professional
              trading account separate. Become familiar with the account
              interface and take advantage of the free trading tools and
              research offered exclusively to clients. A number of brokers offer
              virtual trading. Some sites, including Investopedia, also offer
              online broker reviews to help you find the right broker.

            <b>Learn to Read:</b>
            <p>
              Financial articles, stock market books, website tutorials, etc.
              There's a wealth of information out there, much of it inexpensive
              to tap. It's important not to focus too narrowly on one single
              aspect of the trading game. Instead, study everything market-wise,
              including ideas and concepts you don't feel are particularly
              relevant at this time. Trading launches a journey that often winds
              up at a destination not anticipated at the starting line. Your
              broad and detailed market background will come in handy over and
              over again, even if you think you know exactly where you’re going
              right now. Start to follow the market every day in your spare
              time. Get up early and read about overnight price action on
              foreign markets. (U.S. traders didn't have to monitor global
              markets a couple of decades ago, but that’s all changed due to the
              rapid growth of electronic trading and derivative instruments that
              link equity, forex, and bond markets around the world.) News sites
              such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and CBS MoneyWatch serve as
              great resources for new investors. For more sophisticated
              coverage, you need look no further than The Wall Street Journal
              and Bloomberg.

            <b>Learn to Analyze: </b>
            <p>
              Study the basics of technical analysis and look at price
              charts—thousands of them—in all time frames. You may think
              fundamental analysis offers a better path to profits because it
              tracks growth curves and revenue streams, but traders live and die
              by price action that diverges sharply from underlying
              fundamentals. Do not stop reading company spreadsheets, because
              they offer a trading edge over those who ignore them. However,
              they won’t help you survive your first year as a trader. Your
              experience with charts and technical analysis now brings you into
              the magical realm of price prediction. Theoretically, securities
              can only go higher or lower, encouraging a long-side trade or a
              short sale. In reality, prices can do many other things, including
              chopping sideways for weeks at a time or whipsawing violently in
              both directions, shaking out buyers and sellers. The time horizon
              becomes extremely important at this juncture. Financial markets
              grind out trends and trading ranges with fractal properties that
              generate independent price movements at short-term,
              intermediate-term, and long-term intervals. This means a security
              or index can carve out a long-term uptrend, intermediate
              downtrend, and a short-term trading range, all at the same time.
              Rather than complicate prediction, most trading opportunities will
              unfold through interactions between these time intervals. Buying
              the dip offers a classic example, with traders jumping into a
              strong uptrend when it sells off in a smaller time period. The
              best way to examine this three-dimensional playing field is to
              look at each security in three time frames, starting with
              60-minute, daily, and weekly charts.

            <b>Practice Trading: </b>
            <p>
              It’s now time to get your feet wet without giving up your trading
              stake. Paper trading, or virtual trading, offers a perfect
              solution, allowing the neophyte to follow real-time market
              actions, making buying and selling decisions that form the outline
              of a theoretical performance record. It usually involves the use
              of a stock market simulator that has the look and feel of an
              actual stock exchange's performance. Make lots of trades, using
              different holding periods and strategies, and then analyze the
              results for obvious flaws. Investopedia has a free stock market
              game, and many brokers let clients engage in paper trading with
              their real money entry systems, too. This has the added benefit of
              teaching the software so you don’t hit the wrong buttons when you
              are playing with family funds. So, when do you make the switch and
              start trading with real money? There’s no perfect answer because
              simulated trading carries a flaw that’s likely to show up whenever
              you start to trade for real, even if your paper results look
              perfect. Traders need to coexist peacefully with the twin emotions
              of greed and fear. Paper trading doesn’t engage these emotions,
              which can only be experienced through actual profit and loss. In
              fact, this psychological aspect forces more first-year players out
              of the game than bad decision-making. Your baby steps forward as a
              new trader need to recognize this challenge and address remaining
              issues with money and self-worth.

            <b>Other Ways to Learn and Practice Trading: </b>
            <p>
              Though experience is a fine teacher, don't forget about additional
              education as you proceed on your trading career. Whether online or
              in-person, classes can be beneficial, and you can find them at
              levels ranging from novice (with advice on how to analyze the
              aforementioned analytic charts, for example) to pro. More
              specialized seminars—often conducted by a professional trader—can
              provide valuable insight into the overall market and specific
              investment strategies. Most focus on a specific type of asset, a
              particular aspect of the market, or a trading technique. Some may
              be academic, while others are more like workshops in which you
              actively take positions, test out entry and exit strategies, and
              engage in other exercises (often with a simulator). Paying for
              research and analysis can be both educational and useful. Some
              investors may find watching or observing market professionals to
              be more beneficial than trying to apply newly learned lessons
              themselves. There are a slew of paid subscription sites available
              across the web: Two well-respected services include Investors.com
              and Morningstar. It's also useful to get yourself a mentor—a
              hands-on coach to guide you, critique your technique, and offer
              advice. If you don't know one, you can buy one. Many online
              trading schools offer mentoring as part of their continuing ed
              programs.
